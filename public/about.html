<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Dimitra! I am an electrical engineer and i aspire to be a software engineer and even more. 
  I graduated in April, 2024 with an Integrated Master from the Electrical and Computer Engineering School of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
  My thesis combined biomedical data and deep learning and it had the title: 
  <i>"Techniques for the analysis of Morphological and Functional Characteristics of the Heart in Echocardiography Data."</i>
  I would consider myself a reliable, thoughtful and a collaborative team member. 
  I enjoy being part of a work environment that allows me to grow, 
  challenges me to become better, and provides opportunities to apply my creativity.
